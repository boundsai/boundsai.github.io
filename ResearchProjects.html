          <h3>Research Focus</h3>
          <p>
            At the Autonomous Agents Lab, we are pioneering the future of robotics and autonomous systems.
            Leveraging advanced sensor technologies like 3D LiDAR, thermal imaging, millimeter wave radar and depth sensing,
            we create intelligent systems that navigate and interact seamlessly with their environments. Our high-performance
            computing hardware ensures these systems operate with unparalleled efficiency and precision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, we are exploring the potential of autonomous racing with our cutting-edge F1 tenth system, with plans to
            expand next year by acquiring a diverse array of robotic platforms. These will include teleoperation arms, agile robotic
            dogs, versatile industrial robots, innovative drones, and autonomous ground and sea vehicles. We aim to revolutionize
            fields such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, autonomous transportation, and industrial automation. By
            integrating these technologies, we are developing innovative solutions that enhance human capabilities, tackle complex
            challenges, and improve quality of life in dynamic and impactful ways.

            <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong>
              Dense correspondence estimation between images is a fundamental component for computer vision tasks such as
              structure-from-motion, multi-view stereo and visual localization. Achieving robust correspondences under varying
              illumination, viewpoint changes and occlusions remains a major challenge. This project proposes a method that leverages
              multi-modal sensor fusion and transformer-based architectures to improve robustness and accuracy.

            <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong>
              In this project, we train large-scale protein language models using metagenomic protein sequences. We then curate datasets
              of industrially relevant enzymes from metagenomic data and fine-tune our models on these datasets. We generate synthetic
              proteins and evaluate them first through computational simulations and then by producing and testing them in laboratory
              conditions. Our goal is to discover novel industrial enzymes that do not have direct natural counterparts, yet are more
              active, scalable, and robust compared to existing alternatives in nature.

              information will be extracted from dozens of historical sources to build a knowledge graph. Retrieval-augmented question
              answering (RAG) and knowledge-graph–augmented question answering (Graph-RAG) methods will be tested.
